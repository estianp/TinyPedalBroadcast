## Requirements

| Supported API | Windows | Linux |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Le Mans Ultimate | No plugin required | Requires third-party plugin |
| Le Mans Ultimate (legacy) | rF2SharedMemoryMapPlugin | rF2SharedMemoryMapPlugin(Wine) |
| rFactor 2 | rF2SharedMemoryMapPlugin | rF2SharedMemoryMapPlugin(Wine) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `Le Mans Ultimate (legacy)` API is provided only as a fallback option for Linux user. This option will be removed in the future.

### Display Mode

Game display mode must be set to `Borderless` or `Windowed` to show overlay. `Fullscreen` mode is not supported.

### Setup for Le Mans Ultimate

#### Windows

* There is no plugin required for accessing LMU's built-in API on Windows. However, make sure `Enable Plugins` option is turned `ON` from in game `Settings` -> `Gameplay` page.

#### Linux

* LMU's built-in API can be selected on Linux, but may not work without support from third-party plugin (see discussion [#9](https://github.com/TinyPedal/TinyPedal/issues/9)).

* Alternatively, `rF2 Shared Memory Map Plugin` can be used for accessing LMU legacy API. Please follow [Setup for rFactor 2](#setup-for-rfactor-2) and [Running on Linux](#running-on-linux) sections for instruction.

### Setup for rFactor 2

TheIronWolf's [rF2 Shared Memory Map Plugin](https://github.com/TheIronWolfModding/rF2SharedMemoryMapPlugin) is required for accessing `rFactor 2` API.

#### Windows

* Download the plugin from:\
https://github.com/TheIronWolfModding/rF2SharedMemoryMapPlugin#download

#### Linux

* Download the forked plugin for Wine from:\
https://github.com/schlegp/rF2SharedMemoryMapPlugin_Wine/blob/master/build

#### Install plugin

The plugin file is named `rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin64.dll` and should be placed in:

- For `rFactor 2`, it is `rFactor 2\Bin64\Plugins` folder.

- For `Le Mans Ultimate` (legacy API only), it is `Le Mans Ultimate\Plugins` folder.

Note, manually create this `Plugins` folder if it is missing.

#### Enable plugin in game

- For `rFactor 2`, in game `Settings` -> `Gameplay` page, find `Plugins` section and toggle on `rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin64.dll`.

- For `Le Mans Ultimate` (legacy API only):
    1. In `Le Mans Ultimate\UserData\player` folder, find and open `CustomPluginVariables.JSON` file with notepad, then set `" Enabled"` value to `1`.
    2. In game `Settings` -> `Gameplay` page, find `Enable Plugins` option and make sure it is turned `ON`.

After plugin enabled, must `restart game` to take effect.

Note, if game cannot generate `rFactor2SharedMemoryMapPlugin64.dll` entry in `CustomPluginVariables.JSON` file, make sure `VC12 (Visual C++ 2013) runtime` is installed, which can be found in game's `Support\Runtimes` folder.

## Quick Start

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure required plugins for specific game are installed according to [Requirements](#requirements).
>
> DO NOT extract TinyPedal into `system` or `game` folder, such as `Program Files` or `rFactor 2` folder, otherwise it may fail to run.
>
> See [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/TinyPedal/TinyPedal/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) for common issues, and [User Guide](https://github.com/TinyPedal/TinyPedal/wiki/User-Guide) for usage info.
>
> For Linux user, please follow [Running on Linux](#running-on-linux) section for instruction.

1. Download latest TinyPedal version from [Releases](https://github.com/TinyPedal/TinyPedal/releases) page, extract it into a clean folder, and run `tinypedal.exe`.

2. A tray icon will appear at system tray. If not shown, check hidden tray icon. `Right Click` on tray icon will bring up context menu.

3. Launch game, overlay will appear once vehicle is on track, and auto-hide otherwise. Auto-hide can be toggled On and Off by clicking `Auto Hide` from tray menu.

4. Overlay can be Locked or Unlocked by clicking `Lock Overlay` from tray menu. While Unlocked, click on overlay to drag around.

5. Widgets can be Enabled or Disabled from `Widget` panel in main window. `Right Click` on tray icon and select `Config` to show main window if it is hidden.

6. To quit APP, `Right Click` on tray icon and select `Quit`; or, click `Overlay` menu from main window and select `Quit`.

## Spectate Mode

TinyPedal includes a built-in spectate panel for monitoring and switching between drivers during a session.

### Features

- **Driver List** — View all drivers with position in class, class name, and status tags.
- **Focus Camera** — Switch the in-game camera to the selected driver (LMU, requires REST API enabled).
- **Live Timing** — View real-time lap times, sector splits, best sectors, and gap data for the spectated driver.
- **Battle Detection** — Drivers within 1 second of a same-class car are highlighted red `[BATTLE]`, within 2 seconds orange.
- **Status Tags** — `[PIT]`, `[YELLOW]`, `[BLUE]` tags indicate driver status. Yellow and blue flagged drivers are excluded from battle detection.
- **Sticky Yellow Flag** — Yellow flag highlights persist for 5 seconds after a driver resumes speed, making it easier to track incidents.
- **Sort Modes** — Toggle between Standings (position order) and Relative (gap to spectated driver) views.
- **Hotkeys** — Spectate next/previous driver via configurable keyboard shortcuts.

### Usage

1. Open the main window and navigate to the **Spectate** tab.
2. Click **Enabled** to activate spectate mode.
3. Select a driver from the list and click **Spectate** or double-click to switch.
4. Click **Focus Camera** to move the in-game camera to the selected driver.

> [!NOTE]
> Focus Camera requires the game's REST API to be enabled. In LMU, ensure `Enable Plugins` is turned ON in game settings.

## Run from source

### Dependencies:
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.8, 3.9, or 3.10
* PySide2
* pyLMUSharedMemory
* pyRfactor2SharedMemory
* psutil

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to check Python version before installing additional dependencies.
>
> PySide2 may not be available for Python version higher than 3.10; or requires PySide6 instead for running with newer Python version. PySide6 is currently supported only via command line argument, see [Command Line Arguments](https://github.com/TinyPedal/TinyPedal/wiki/User-Guide#command-line-arguments) in User Guide for details.

### Download source code

#### Method 1

1. Download TinyPedal source code from [Releases](https://github.com/TinyPedal/TinyPedal/releases) page; or click `Code` button at the top of repository and select `Download ZIP`.

2. Download submodule source code from following links:
    - pyLMUSharedMemory: https://github.com/TinyPedal/pyLMUSharedMemory
    - pyRfactor2SharedMemory: https://github.com/TinyPedal/pyRfactor2SharedMemory

3. Extract TinyPedal source code ZIP file. Then extract submodule ZIP files and put them in corresponding folder in the root folder of TinyPedal.

#### Method 2

1. Use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) tool and run following command to clone TinyPedal source code alongside required submodules:\
    `git clone --recursive https://github.com/TinyPedal/TinyPedal.git`
2. To update submodules, run command:\
    `git submodule update --init`

### Install dependencies

Install additional dependencies by using command:\
`pip3 install PySide2 psutil`

To start TinyPedal, type command from root folder:\
`python run.py`

## Build executable for Windows

Executable file can be built with [py2exe](http://www.py2exe.org).

To install py2exe, run command:\
`pip3 install py2exe`

To build executable file, run command:\
`python freeze_py2exe.py`

After building completed, executable file can be found in `dist\TinyPedal` folder.

> [!NOTE]
> The build script only supports py2exe `v0.12.0.0` or higher. The build script does not support PySide6.

## Running on Linux

The procedure described in the [Run from source](#run-from-source) section is mostly valid,
except some differences in the dependencies, and that no executable can be
built. The differences are explained here.

Configuration and data files will be stored in the defined user-specific
directories, default to:\
`$HOME/.config/TinyPedal/`\
`$HOME/.local/share/TinyPedal/`

The required Python packages are `PySide2`, `psutil` and `pyxdg`. Most distros
name the package with a prefix, like `python3-pyside2`, `python3-psutil` and
`python3-pyxdg`.

Some distros split `PySide2` in subpackages. If you don't find
`python3-pyside2` then you should install `python3-pyside2.qtgui`,
`python3-pyside2.qtwidgets` and `python3-pyside2.qtmultimedia`.

Alternatively, you can install them using `pip3` but this will bypass your
system package manager and it isn't the recommended option. The command to
install the dependencies with this method is:\
`pip3 install PySide2 psutil pyxdg`

To start TinyPedal type the following command:\
`./run.py`

### Installation

Once you have a working instance of TinyPedal, created using the git command or
by unpacking the Linux release file, you can run the install script to install
or update TinyPedal on your system.

The install script will create a desktop launcher and will make `TinyPedal`
available as a command from the terminal.

The files will be installed at the `/usr/local/` prefix. You'll need
appropriate permissions to write there, for example, by using `sudo`.

You can run the script as (it doesn't support any arguments or options):\
`sudo ./install.sh`

If you need persistent launch arguments (for example, to force PySide6), create
`~/.config/TinyPedal/launcher.conf` with:

```sh
TINYPEDAL_RUN_ARGS="--pyside 6"
```

The installed launcher and desktop entry will read this file automatically. This is mainly useful for ArchLinux where `PySide2` is deprecated.

### Known issues

- Some features may not be available on Linux currently.
- Widgets don't appear over the game window in KDE. Workaround: enable `Bypass Window Manager` option in `Compatibility` dialog from `Config` menu in main window.
- Transparency of widgets doesn't work when desktop compositing is disabled. Workaround: enable `window manager compositing` in your Desktop Environment.
